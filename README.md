To-Do List Application

This is my first To-Do List Application built using PHP. The primary goal of this project is to create a simple yet functional task management tool where users can add, view, and manage their daily tasks. This project has helped me deepen my understanding of backend development with PHP and practice working with databases.

Features
Add Tasks: Users can easily add new tasks to their to-do list.
View Tasks: All tasks are displayed in a clean and organized format, showing task names.
Delete Tasks: Users can remove tasks once they are completed or no longer needed.
Task Persistence: Data is stored in a MySQL database, ensuring tasks remain available even after refreshing the page.

Technologies Used
PHP: Server-side scripting for handling task management logic.
MySQL: Database management to store and retrieve tasks.
HTML/CSS: Basic frontend structure and styling for the user interface.
XAMPP: Used as a local development environment.

Getting Started

XAMPP or any other PHP and MySQL environment.
